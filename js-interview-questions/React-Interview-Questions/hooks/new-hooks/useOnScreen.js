// Tracking the componentâ€™s visibility can be really handy in
// multiple cases, especially for performance, when you want to
// load to the media like image, video, audio, etc. only when the
// component is in the viewport or is visible.

// Another case is when you want to track the user activity like
// when the user is a starring a product (product is in the viewport)
// so that you can use this data for recommendations.

// Using Intersection Observer
// With useRef() we will create a reference to the DOM element which
//  we want to track,
//  and then pass this to the useOnScreen() hook.

// useOnScreen() hook will set up the observation for the ref when the
//  component will be mounted. This is will be done in the useEffect()
//  and then create an instance of IntersectionObserver and if the
//  entry is interacting, update the state to true which means it visible, otherwise false.

// Disconnect the observation when the component is about to unmount
// inside the useEffect().
